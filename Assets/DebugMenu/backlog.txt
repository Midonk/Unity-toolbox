display different type of ui depending of the type of parameter of the methods

End usage:
I want to have multiple input types in my menu:
- Buttons that invoke a [static] method V
- Buttons that navigate deeper in arborescence (marked with '>') placed on top of the current panel
- Toggles that invoke bool method on value changes
- int input like "< 0 >" that increase with horizontal axis or mouse click or input value directly to invoke number method
- enum input like "< myEnum >" that loop on enum values with horizontal axis or click to invoke enum method
- sliders that invoke number method, min value, max value, may have a unit (%, s, ...)

All of this should be stored somewhere to be reminded
I want to be able to reset everything with a single button
I want to access some method more easily with quick debug menu
I want to be able to navigate with my keyboard only
