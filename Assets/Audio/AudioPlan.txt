IDEA: why not convert players into scriptable and only have kind of...sockets on the gameobject that have a source and a player ?
This way a player become a kind of library

The current system only cares about how the sound plays not when the sound plays (that may be too complex to implement)
An AudioPlayer is an handle that register a list of AudioElements of the same type (sharing a common logic)
An AudioElement is a piece of logic handling sound(s) behaviour. [Two AudioElements of the same type may differ in some aspect like the way the play or stop via outter logic]
An AudioGroup is an handle allowing to manage a list of AudioPlayer with a single reference.
